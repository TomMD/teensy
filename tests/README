# Tests 1--11 written by Rebekah Leslie.

All tests are run on the first instance of the teensy device.

1--5. Write before read.

Test the ability to write an element into the device and read back the same
result.  The tests evaluate the driver's ability to write then read in an
empty list (test 1), a singleton list (test 2), and a multi-item list where 
the index is at the end of the list (test3), the middle of the list (test4),
or the head of the list (test5).  Each test is successful if the value read
from the device equals the value written (data taken from files in the data
directory).

6--10. Deletion of a node.

Test node deletion using ioctl.  The tests evaluate the driver's ability to
delete an item from an empty list (test 10), a singleton list (test 11), and a
multi-item list where the deleted item is at the end of the list (test 12),
the middle of the list (test 13), or the head of the list (test 14).  The test
on an empty list simply checks that the operation succeeded.  Each other 
test is successful if a non-blocking read can no longer access a previously
written node after a call to delete.

11. Overwriting a node.

Test the behavior of the device when two different blobs are written to the
same index.  Write twice to the same index, and perform a read.  The test
succeeds if the second blob written is returned.
